# How dO i write a script for a web page?
First of all, you need to know how it will fit together with the HTML and CSS in your web pages.

Web developers usually talk about three languages that
are used to create web pages:HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.the  aim is to keep these three languages in separate files, with the HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files.Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose,and each layer builds on the previous one.
1. html files:This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.
2. css files :The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how
the HTML content is presented (backgrounds,dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).
3. js files:This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity.

# PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT:
These three layers form the basis for building web pages called incremental optimization.
# Constructive & Co.:
* HTML ONLY:
Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most important thing about your site: its content.These layers should work with all types of Hardware, which is in all cars, and is loaded very quickly Slow connections.
* HTML+CSS :
Adding CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules about how the page should appear independent of the content itself.You can use the same style sheet with all of your websites, making Sites load faster and are easier to maintain. Or, you can use different style sheets with the same content to create different views of the same data.
* HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT :
JavaScript has been added finally and it enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with site.Keeping it separate means that the page will still work if the user cannot load or run JavaScript. You can also reuse the code on different pages which makes the site load faster and easier to maintain.
# CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT:
JavaScript is written in plain text, like HTML and CSS, so you don't need any new tools to write a script.
1. Create a folder to place, then start your favorite code editor, and enter the text.A JavaScript file is a text file (like HTML and CSS files) but it does contain. js file, so save this file with the name of Additional Content.Js.
2. In your code editor, enter the HTML code. then Save
this file with .html.
3. Open the HTML file.
4. view the source code for the page. The source of the web page shows the link to the JavaScript file.
5. placing the script in the page :open the HTML file,and removing the src attribute from the opening <script> tag, and adding the
new code.
6. Open the HTML file in your web browser.
# How To Use The Objects And Methods:
by calling  a method of an attribute.
* Object
* Member Operator
*Method
# BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS
1. STATEMENTS: Text is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one by one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Phrases must end with a semicolon.
2.COMMENTS:Y to explain what your code does.it help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. 
# VARIABLE :
The script will have to temporarily store the pieces of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.Some of the operations that need to be given to the computer are very detailed instructions. You might ask him to do the following four steps in order:
      1. Remember the value for width
      2.Remember the value for height
      3.Multiply width by height to get the area
      4.Return the result to the user
Variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change or differ every time the script is run.The use of variables to represent numbers or other types of data is very similar to the concept of algebra in which letters are used to represent numbers.
# DATA TYPES:
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.there are many types of datatype :
 * NUMERIC DATA TYPE : The numeric data type handles
numbers.
 * STRING DATA TYPE :The strings data type consists of
letters and other characters.
 * BOOLEAN DATA TYPE :Boolean data types can have one
of two va lues: true or false.
# RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES :
 * The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_).  
* It must not start with a number. 
*The name can contain letters,numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). 
* you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
* You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
* All variables are case sensitive.
*Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
* If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.
