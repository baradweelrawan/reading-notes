# What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.it has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
# has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer:
   1. code completion: allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed
   2. syntax highlighting: a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text
   3. a nice variety of themes o reduce eye strain and fatigue 
   4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them .
 5. able to write your HTML and CSS more efficiently
 6. series of themes :These themes will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well.
# Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer :
Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.”And on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text
editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of your particular distribution. There are other text
editors that have features that you may be interested in, like the ones we discussed before. Usually, the text editors that come on your computer don’t have many features to speak of. They’re the barest bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.
# If you want to try using the text editors that come with your
computer, there’s a couple of caveats that I’d like to make you aware of:
1. make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on
your computer, that you’re creating code in a plain text editor.
2. You
should not see options for making text bold, underlined, or italic.Plain text has no formatting options.
3. If you can make your text bold, underlined or italic, then you might need to change a setting somewhere. Please
make sure you’re coding in plain text. 
4. make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on your computer, that you first create a folder on your computer somewhere maybe on your Desktop to store your entire website.
5. As you create new documents with the text editor that comes on your computer, save those files in the appropriate folders or sub-folders within the main website folder.
6. make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they
have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names.
# Third-Party Options:
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded and installed to your computer from their respective websites.

ublime Text enjoys a history of being fast and responsive while being extensible as well. There’s no doubt that Sublime Text will tick the check boxes of what to look for in a text editor. It has syntax highlighting, it has code
completion, it has themes and extensions.

# The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs:
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is  suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
