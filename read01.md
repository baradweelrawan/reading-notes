## Markdown
***Markdown:is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform and is a way to style text on the web.***
**By Markedown you can control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images and creating lists and these are just a few of the
things we can do with Markdown.**

**Writing In Markdown - Lists**
Menus come in two flavors in Markdown. There are unordered lists and ordered lists. The first item in the list must be preceded by a blank line. The menu item can have another Markdown format, but neither the list bullet nor the item number can. It should be plain text.An unordered list is a simple bullet list. There's not much to an unordered list. It must be separated from a text block by one blank like and each list item must be preceded by a hyphen, plus or asterisk. I use hyphen characters ("-") exclusively for bullet lists.
