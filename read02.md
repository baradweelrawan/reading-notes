# Guide of Git:
 At first it must be defined the Version Control;It is a system that allows you to revisit the different versions of a file or group of files by recording changes. With version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modify individuals, and compare changes. So that errors in files can be easily corrected.There are many versions of Version Control such as:
# 1. Local Version Control
# 2.Centralized Version Control 
# 3. Distributed Version Control.
# So, what is Git?
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Every time you save a changed version of your project - called commit - Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the mirrored version already stored of it.
