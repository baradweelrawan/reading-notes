 3. How information is represented using elecricity?
 4.How computer use circuits to do every things?
The computer change the world, and the different parts of computers the input, output and store all the information
# What makes a computer a computer:
the computer Is available every where in the packet,cars and offices.
to design machine it walk in many differenttasks;it would need to:
       1. take input.
       2. store information
       3. processe it.
       4. output the result.
these are a common to all computer and tats what make a computer a computer.
# input:
there are many types of input. what is the input its a stuff the world does make a computerdo stuff, you can tell computerto do in the keyboread,what to do the mouse,camera ,mik....
# storage and processing :
all the difference input give a computer information which then store in memory.
a computer processor takes informationfrom memory and then manipulated with changes algorithim its just series of command,then since the process informationback to be stored in memory again.
Then ready to output.
# output :
How the computer output information depends on what computer design?
a computer display shows a text,photo,videos,games,VR and when the computer connect over the internet the output from computer become input another.
# Data And Binary:
the computerwork on ones and zeros but almost nobody deals directly with ones and zeros.
ones and zeros; do play a big work in how computer work on the inside.
inside the computerthere are an electric wires and circuitsthat carry all the information in a computer.

 * How do you store or represented information using elecricity?
    1. single wire :it could be ON or OFF. its important to be start,its called a bit and its the smallest piece of information a computercan store.Even if we use 1 wire there are 2 bits (0.1)
    using 2 wires there are 8 bit ...
with more bits you can represented more complex information
# The Binary System :
we only have 2 digit (0,1) with tgese 2 digits we can count uo any numbers. In Binary each position carry a value,the important is any number can be represented with ones and zeros.
if we use 8 wire :we can store the number between 0 and 255.
32 wires we can store the number between 0 and 4 Billion.
with Binary number also can represent the image, text,and videos.
   1. text in binary: we can represent any pargraph to the sequence number and thses numbers stores in ones and zeros singles.
   2. image in binary : photo,videos and graphics it made of many pixels and each pixels has a color (red,blue,green)and each of color represented with numbers.
   3. sound in binary :every sound is a series of vibration. vibration come be represented graphicaly as a wave form, any point in the waves can be represented by a numberin this way the sound can be broken down into a series of numbers.
