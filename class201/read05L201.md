There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

# Choosing Images for Your Site:
A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.Images should:
   * Be relevant
   * Convey information
   * Convey the right mood
   *  Be instantly recognisable
   * Fit the color palette
# Storing Images on Your Site  :
As a website grows, keeping images in a separate folder helps you understand how the site is organized.On a big site you might like to
add subfolders inside the images folder .If you are using a content
management system or blogging platform, there are usually tools built into the admin site that allow you to upload images,and the program will probably already have a separate folder for image files and any
other uploads.
# Adding Images (<img>):
To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element which means there is no closing tag. It must carry the
following two attributes:
1.src :tells the browser where it can find the image file.
2. alt: provides a text description of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.
3. title :to provide additional information about the image.

# Height & Width of Images:
1. height: This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
2. width: This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
that the browser can render the rest of the text on the page while leaving the right amount of space for the image that is still loading.
# Where to Place Images in Your Code:
Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed.
1.  before a paragraph
2. 2: inside the start of a paragraph
3. in the middle of a paragraph
Where you place the image in the code is important because browsers show HTML elements in one of two ways:
 * Block elements always appear on a new line.
 * Inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line.
# Rules for Creating Images:
There are three rules to remember when you are creating images for your website:
1. Save images in the right format
2. Save images at the right size
3. Use the correct resolution
# Tools to Edit & Save Images:
There are several tools you can use to edit and save images to ensure that they are the right size, format, and resolution.
1. Adobe Photoshop.

The most popular tool amongst web professionals.
* Image Formats as GIF
* Image Formats as JPEG


# Image Dimensions:
The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.
1. REDUCING IMAGE SIZE: You can reduce the size of images to create a smaller version of the image
2. INCREASING IMAGE SIZE : You can't increase the size of photos significantly without affecting the image quality.
3. CHANGING SHAPE :Only some images can be cropped without losing valuable information .
# Cropping Images :
When cropping images it is important not to lose valuable information. It is best to source images that are the correct shape if possible.
# Image Resolution :
Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.Images appearing on computer screens are made of tiny squares called pixels.computers display images at a resolution of 72 pixels per inch
(ppi).
# Vector Images :

Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.Vector images are created by placing points on a grid, and
drawing lines between those points. A color can then be added to "fill in" the lines that have been created.The advantage of creating line
drawings in vector format is that you can increase the dimensions
of the image without affecting the quality of it.
# Animated GIFs :

Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.Some image editing applications
such as Adobe Photoshop allow you to create animated GIFs.
# Transparency:
![img](https://project-management.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/transparency-in-pm.png)
Creating an image that is partially transparentor "see-through" for the web involves selecting one of two formats: 
    1. Transparent GIF
    2.PNG 
# Examining Images on the Web  :
1. Checking the Size of Images  
2. Downloading Images
# HTML 5: Figure and Fi gure Caption:
1. <figure> :You can have more than one image inside the <figure>
element as long as they all share the same caption.
2. <figcaption> :has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.
# Color :
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. rgb values: Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
2. hex codes :Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in
hexadecimal code.
3. color names:Colors are represented by predefined names. However,
they are very limited in number.
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker,Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels.Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like
Photoshop and GIMP.for Background Color;You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values,hex codes, and color names.
# Contrast :
When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible. 
 * Low Contrast
 * High Contrast
 * Medium Contrast
# Opacity :
1. opacity :allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 ;so a value of 0.5is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity. 
2. rgba :allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity.
# Text:
The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:
 1. directly affect the font and its appearance
 2. same effect on text no matter what font you were using
# Typeface Terminology :
 * Serif 
 * Sans-Serif
 * Monospace 
 * Weight 
 * Style
 * tretch
# Techniques That Offer a Wider Choice of Typefaces :
There are several ways to use fonts other than those listed on the previous page. However, typefaces are subject to copyright, so the
techniques you can choose from are limited by their respective licenses.
1. font-family: allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the elements to which a CSS rule applies.
2. font-face : allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed
on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine.
3. Service-based Font-Face
# Size of Type :
property enables you to specify a size for the font. There are several ways to specify the size of a font. The most common are:
1. pixels :commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control
over how much space their text takes up.
2. percentages: The default size of text in browsers is 16px. So a size of 75% would be the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px.
3. ems : is equivalent to the width of a letter m.
# Bold (font-weight) :
allows you to create bold text. There are two values that this property commonly takes:
1. normal :This causes text to appear at a normal weight.
2. bold :This causes text to appear bold.
# font-style :
1. normal
2. italic
3. oblique 
# text-transform :
is used to change the case of text giving it one of the following
values:
  1. uppercase
  2. lowercase 
  3. capitalize
# text-decoration :
1. none
2. underline
3. overline
4. line-through
5. blink
# Leading (line-height) :
term typographers use for the vertical space between lines of text. In a typeface, the part of a letter that drops beneath the baseline is called a descender, while the highest point of a letter is called the ascender. Increasing the line-height makes the vertical gap between
lines of text larger. 
# Alignment (text-align) :
allows you to control the alignment of text. The property can take one
of four values:
     1. left
     2. right
     3. center
     4. justify
# Vertical Alignment: 
It is not intended to allow you to vertically align text in the middle
of block level elements such as <p> and <div>, although it does have this effect when used with table cells the <td> and <th> elements.
# Indenting Text :
allows you to indent the first line of text within an element.The amount you want the line indented by can be specified in a number of ways but is usually given in pixels or ems,It can take a negative value.    
# Drop Shadow (text-shadow) :
It is used to create a drop shadow, which is a dark version of the word just behind it and slightly offset. It can also be used to create an embossed effect by adding a shadow that is slightly lighter than the text.The first length indicates how far to the left or right the shadow
should fall.The second value indicates the distance to the top or bottom
that the shadow should fall.The third value is optional and specifies the amount of blur that should be applied to the drop shadow.The fourth value is the color of the drop shadow.
# First Lett er or Line:
You can specify different values for the first letter or first line of
text inside an element using :first-letter and :first-line.
# Styling Links :
In CSS, there are two pseudoclasses that allow you to set different styles for links that have and have not yet been visited.
   1. :link: This allows you to set styles for links that have not yet been visited.
   2. :visited :This allows you to set styles for links that have been clicked on. They are commonly used to control colors of the links and
also whether they are to appear underlined or not. 
# Responding to Users:
There are three pseudo-classes that allow you to change the appearance of elements when a user is interacting with them:
  1. :hover: applied when a user hovers over an element with a pointing device such as a mouse.This has commonly been used to change the appearance of links and buttons when a user places their cursor over them.
  2. :active :applied when an element is being activated by a user; for
example, when a button is being pressed or a link being clicked.
Sometimes this is used to make a button or link feel more like it is being pressed by changing the style or position of the element slightly.
  3. :focus: applied when an element has focus. Any element that you can interact with, such as a link you can click on or any form control can have focus.Focus occurs when a browser discovers that you are ready to interact with an element on the page.
# Attribute Selectors:  
There are also a set of attribute selectors that allow you to create rules that apply to elements that have an attribute with a specific value: 
    1. Existence: Matches a specific attribute
    2. Equality :Matches a specific attribute with a specific value
    3. Space :Matches a specific attribute whose value appears in a spaceseparated list of words
    4. Prefix: Matches a specific attribute whose value begins with a specific string
    5. SubString :Matches a specific attribute whose value contains a specific substring.
    6. Suffix : Matches a specific attribute whose value ends with a specific string.
