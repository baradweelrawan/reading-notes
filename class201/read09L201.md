# Form:
An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site.
  1. ADDING TEXT:
     The <input> element is used to create several different form controls.
       * Text input:When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a singleline text input.
       * Password input: When the type attribute has a value of password it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out.They are hidden.
       * Text area: used to create a mutli-line text input.Any text that appears between the opening <textarea> and closing </textarea> tags will appear in the text box when the page loads.
   2. Making Choices: 
       * Radio buttons : Radio buttons allow users to pick just one of a number of options.
       * Checkboxes :allow users to select and unselect one or more options in answer to a question.
       * Drop-down boxes: list box also known as a select box allows users to select one option from a drop down list.is used to create a drop down list box. It contains two or more <option>elements.
   3. Submitting Forms:     
       * Submit buttons:sed to send a form to the server.
       * Image buttons:If you want to use an image for the submit button,
   4. Uploading Files    
# How Forms Work:
A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element.
 1. A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.   
 2. The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
 3. The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net,or Java. It may also store the information in a database.
 4. The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.

# Form Structure <form>:
Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.
   1. action :Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.
   2. method :can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
       * get method :values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. The get method is ideal for;short forms and when you are just retrieving data from the web server not sending information that should be added to or deleted from a database
       * post method :values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should use it if your form:allows users to upload a file, is very long,contains sensitive data and adds information to, or deletes information from, a database.
   3. id :the value is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the page and is often used by scripts â€” such as those that check you have entered information into fields that require values.

# Button & hidden Controls :
1. <button> : allow users more control over how their buttons appear, and to allow other elements to appear inside the button.that you can combine text and images between the opening <button>tag and closing </button> tag.
2. <input> :They allow web page authors to add values to forms that users cannot see.For example, a web page author might use a hidden field to indicate which page the user was on when they submitted a form.

# Labelling Form Controls <label>:

![img](https://www.deque.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Anatomy-accessible-forms-required-field.png)

element can be used in two ways. It can:
1. Wrap around both the text description and the form input
2. Be kept separate from the form control and use the for attribute to indicate which form control it is a label for

# Grouping Form Elements:
  1. <fieldset> :You can group related form controls together inside the <fieldset> element.
  2. <legend> :can come directly after the opening <fieldset> tag and contains a caption which helps identify the purpose of that group of form controls.

# Email & URL Input  :
allow visitors to enter email addresses and URLs.Browsers that do not support these input types will just treat them as text boxes.
  1. type="email" :you can use the email input. Browsers that support HTML5 validation will check
that the user has provided information in the correct format of an email address. Some smart phones also optimize their keyboard to display the keys you are most likely to need when entering an email address .
2. type="url" :can be used when you are asking a user for a web page address.
# Search Input :
If you want to create a single line text box for search queries,
   1. type="search" :If you want to create a single line text box for search queries,To create search box the <input> element should have a type attribute whose value is search. Older browsers will simply treat it like a single line text box.
   2. placeholder :On any text input, you can also use an attribute,is text that will be shown in the text box until the user clicks in that area.

# Lists, Tables and Forms :
list-style, and it allows you to express the markers' style, image and position properties in any order.

1. list-style-type :allows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point also known as a marker.It can be used on rules that apply to the <ol>, <ul>, and <li> elements.
   * Unordered Lists :
   * Ordered Lists
2. list-style-image :You can specify an image to act as a bullet point ,This property can be used on rules that apply to the <ul> and <li> elements. 
3. list-style-position :property indicates whether the marker should  appear on the inside or the outside of the box containing the main points. This property can take one of two values:
    * outside :The marker sits to the left of the block of text. 
    
    * inside :The marker sits inside the box of text 
# Border on Empty Cells:
property to specify whether or not their borders should be shown.It can take one of three values:
 1. show: This shows the borders of any empty cells.
 2. hide : This hides the borders of any empty cells.
 3. inherit :If you have one table nested inside another, the inherit value instructs the table cells to
obey the rules of the containing table.

# Gaps Between Cells :
  1. border-spacing :allows you to control the distance between adjacent cells.and allows you to control the gap.
  2. border-collapse.


# JAVA SCRIPT :

# Events :
When you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this just happened." Your script can then respond to these events.

# DIFFERENT EVENT TYPES :
There are selection of the events that occur in the browser while you are browsing the web:
  
* load :Web page has finished loading
* unload :Web page is unloading usually because a new page was requested
* error: Browser encounters a JavaScript error or an asset doesn't exist.
* resize:Browser window has been resized.
* scroll:User has scrolled up or down the page.
 
# HOW EVENTS TRIGGER JAVASCRIPT CODE :
  1. Select t he element node you want the script to respond to.
  2. Indicate which event on the selected node will trigger the response.When users move out of the text input, it loses focus, and the blur event fires on this element. 
  3. State the code you want to run when the event occurs.

# THREE WAYS TO BIND AN EVENT TO AN ELEMENT :
Event handlers let you indicate which event you are waiting for on any particular element. There are three types of event handlers.   
   1. HTML EVENT HANDLER ATTRIBUTES (DO NOT USE)
   2. USING DOM EVENT HANDLERS
   3. EVENT LISTENERS
   4. USING PARAMETERS WITH EVENT HANDLERS & LISTENERS.

# THE EVENT OBJECT :
When an event occurs, the event object tells you information about the event, and the element it happened upon. it's helpful any function that is the event data about the event :
  1. Which element the event happened on .
  2. Which key was pressed for a to  keypress event.
  3. What part of the viewport the user clicked for a click event.

# EVENT DELEGATION :
Creating event listeners for a lot of elements can slow down a page, but event flow allows you to listen for an event on a parent element.  BENEFITS OF EVENT DELEGATION:
   * WORKS WITH NEW ELEMENTS.
   * SOLVES LIMITATIONS WITH this KEYWORD.
   * SIMPLIFIES YOUR CODE.

# CHANGING DEFAULT BEHAVIOR  :
The event object has methods that change: the default behavior of an element and how the element's ancestors respond to the event. 
  1. preventDefault ():keep the user on the same page rather than following a link or being taken to a new page after submitting a form
  2. stopPropagation() :To stop the event bubbling up
  3. USING BOTH METHODS :It prevents the default behavior of the element, and prevents the event from bubbling up or capturing further. It also works in all browsers, so it is popular.

# DIFFERENT TYPES OF EVENTS  :
  1. W3C DOM EVENTS
  2. HTM LS EVENTS
  3. BOM EVENTS

# USER INTERFACE EVENTS :
User interface CUI) events occur as a result of interaction with the browser window rather than the HTML page contained within it .
