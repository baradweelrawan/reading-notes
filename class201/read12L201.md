Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. So add this to the body of our HTML page:
     <canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
Next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element.Inside the same script tags we need to create our data, in this instance it’s an object that contains labels for the base of our chart and datasets to describe the values on the chart.

# Canvas API :

At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.The id attribute isn't specific to the <canvas> element but is one of the global HTML attributes which can be applied to any HTML element (like class for instance). It is always a good idea to supply an id because this makes it much easier to identify it in a script.The <canvas> element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, background…). These rules, however, don't affect the actual drawing on the canvas. We'll see how this is done in a dedicated chapter of this tutorial. When no styling rules are applied to the canvas it will initially be fully transparent.
# Required </canvas> tag :
As a consequence of the way fallback is provided, unlike the <img> element, the <canvas> element requires the closing tag (</canvas>). If this tag is not present, the rest of the document would be considered the fallback content and wouldn't be displayed.If fallback content is not needed, a simple <canvas id="foo" ...></canvas> is fully compatible with all browsers that support canvas at all.

# Drawing shapes with canvas :
1. The grid :The origin of this grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin. So the position of the top left corner of the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top, at coordinate (x,y). Later in this tutorial we'll see how we can translate the origin to a different position, rotate the grid and even scale it, but for now we'll stick to the default.
2. rectangles : rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex shapes.First let's look at the rectangle.There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas;Each of these three functions takes the same parameters. x and y specify the position on the canvas (relative to the origin) of the top-left corner of the rectangle. width and height provide the rectangle's size:
   * fillRect(x, y, width, height)
   * strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
   * clearRect(x, y, width, height)

3. paths :A path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color. A path, or even a subpath, can be closed. To make shapes using paths, we take some extra steps:
   * create the path.
   * Then you use drawing commands to draw into the path.
   *  you can stroke or fill the path to render it.

# Applying styles and colors :
1. Colors :f we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.Sets the style used when filling shapes:fillStyle = color.Sets the style for shapes' outlines:strokeStyle = color.color is a string representing a CSS <color>, a gradient object, or a pattern object. We'll look at gradient and pattern objects later. By default, the stroke and fill color are set to black (CSS color value #000000).

# Drawing text :
The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:
1. fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth]): Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
2. strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth]): Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.

# Styling text :
making use of the font property to make the text a bit larger than the default size. There are some more properties which let you adjust the way the text gets displayed on the canvas:
  * font = value :The current text style being used when drawing text. This string uses the same syntax as the CSS font property. The default font is 10px sans-serif.
  * textAlign = value :Text alignment setting. Possible values: start, end, left, right or center. The default value is start.
  * textBaseline = value :Baseline alignment setting. Possible values: top, hanging, middle, alphabetic, ideographic, bottom. The default value is alphabetic.
  * direction = value :Directionality. Possible values: ltr, rtl, inherit. The default value is inherit.
