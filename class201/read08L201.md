# HTML Layout :
Websites often display content in multiple columns like a magazine or a newspaper .HTML layouts provide a way to arrange web pages in well-mannered, well-structured, and in responsive form or we can say that HTML layout specifies a way in which the web pages can be arranged. Web-page layout works with arrangement of visual elements of an HTML document.

1. Key Concepts in Positioning Elements :
* Building Blocks :
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes and sometimes the height, too. To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.Block-level elements start on a new line  include:
<h1> <p> <ul> <li>
And Inline elements flow in between surrounding text :
<img> <b> <i> 

* Containing Elements :
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box.it's group a number of elements together inside a <div>
or other block-level element.

# Controlling the Position of Elements :
allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property. there are many types of Position :
  1. Normal flow :Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.The paragraphs appear one after the other, vertically down the page.

  2. Relative Positioning : This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed. This does not affect the position of surrounding elements; they stay in the position they would be in normal flow; and The second paragraph has been pushed down and right from where it would otherwise have been in normal flow.

  3. Absolute positioning : the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements as they simply ignore the space it would have taken up.Absolutely positioned elements move as users scroll up and down the page.

4. box offset : To indicate where a box should be positioned to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.

# Normal Flow :
each block-level element sits on top of the next one.the syntax
would be:
  1.(position: static) : not specified a width property for the heading elemen
  2. (position:relative) : moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
3. (position:absolute) : When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the
position of other elements on the page.
4. (position:fixed) : a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.It positions the element in
relation to the browser window.
5.  z-index : to control which element sits on top,Its value
is a number, and the higher the number the closer that element is to the front.sometimes referred to as the stacking context.
6. float :allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.with it you should also use the width property to indicate how wide the floated element should be.

# Clearing Floats :
allows you to say that no element within the same containing element should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. It can take the following values: 
   * left : should not touch any other elements appearing in the same containing element.
   * right : will not touch elements appearing in the same containing element.
   * both : will touch elements appearing in the same containing element.
   * none :Elements can touch either side.

# Creating Multi-Column Layouts with Floats :
This is achieved by using a <div>element to represent each column.The following three CSS
properties are used to position the columns next to each other:
   1. width : This sets the width of the columns.
   2. float : This positions the columns next to each other.
   3. margin :This creates a gap between the columns.

# Fixed Width Layouts :
designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.Measurements tend to be given in pixels. the Advantages ot it :
   * Pixel values are accurate at controlling size and positioning of elements.  
   * The designer has far greater control over the appearance and position of items on the page than with liquid layouts.
   * The size of an image will always remain the same relative to the rest of the page.
   * You can control the lengths of lines of text regardless of the size of the user's window 
And the Disadvantages are :
   * You can end up with big gaps around the edge of a page.
   * If the user's screen is a much higher resolution than the designer's screen, the page can look smaller and text can be harder to read.
   * If a user increases font sizes,text might not fit into the allotted spaces.
   * The design works best on devices that have a site or resolution similar to that of desktop or laptop computers.
   * The page will often take up more vertical space than a liquid layout with the same content.

# Liquid Layouts :
The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen.designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the
size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.the Advantages are :
   * Pages expand to fill the entire browser window so there are no spaces around the page on a large screen.
   * If the user has a small window, the page can contract to fit it without the user having to scroll to the side.
   * The design is tolerant of users setting font sizes larger than the designer intended.
And the Disadvantages are :
   * If the user has a very narrow window, words may be squashed and you can end up with few words on each line.
   * If a fixed width item such as an image is in a box that is too small to hold it because the user has made the window smaller the image can overflow over the text.
# Layout Grids :
Composition in any visual art is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they areorganized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.While a grid might seem like a restriction, in actual fact it:
  1. Creates a c++ ontinuity between different pages which may use different designs.
  2. Helps users predict where to find information on various pages.
  3. Makes it easier to add new content to the site in a consistent way.
  4. Helps people collaborate on the design of a site in a consistent way.

# CSS Frameworks :
aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.

  * They save you from repeatedly writing code for the same tasks.  
  * They will have been tested across different browser versions which helps avoid browser bugs.
  * They often require that you use class names in your HTML code that only control the presentation of the page rather than describe its content.

# Multiple Style Sheets :
  *  @import :
Some web page authors split up their CSS style rules into separate style sheets.  There are two ways to add multiple style sheets to a page:
   1. Your HTML page can link to one style sheet and that stylesheet can use the @import rule to import other style sheets.
   2. In the HTML you can use a separate <link> element for each style sheet.

* link :
Inside the <head> element is a separate <link> element for each style sheet.The contents of site.css are identical to styles.css on the left hand page, except the code does not contain @import rules.if two rules apply to the same element then rules that appear later in a document will take precedence
over previous rules.
