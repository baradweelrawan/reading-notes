# HTML Tables :
![img](https://data-flair.training/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/Html-Tables.jpg)
A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.
# Basic Table Structure :
1. <table> : The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row by row.
2. <tr> :You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag.It is followed by one or more <td> elements one for each cell in that row.At the end of the row you use a closing </tr> tag.
3. <td> :Each cell of a table is represented using a <td> element. At the end of each cell you use a closing </td> tag.
# Table Headings :
1. <th> :is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row.is used just
like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. and to indicate whether it is a heading for a
column or a row.
1. Spanning ColumnS : 
The colspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.
2. Spanning Rows :
The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.
3. Long Tables :There are three elements that help distinguish between  
main content of the table and the first and last rows:
   * <thead>
   * <tbody>
   * <tfoot>

# creating an object :
1. constructor notation :
  * create a new object and object constructor
  * creat the blank object
  * add parametres and method
  * you can creat an empty object.
# Updating an object :
 you can use dot notatuin to update an object or squer bracket;by the object name followed by squer bracket and inside it put the name of properties.and you can delet it by using(delet) keyword followed by the name of object and property. 

# Creating many object using constructor notation :
 1. creat a templete with the object property and method.
 2. creat an instance of the object using constructor function.

# CREATE & ACCESS OBJECTS CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION :
1. a constructor function defines a template for the object.
2. created instances of these objects
3. you can then access their properties and methods using the same dot
notation that you use with all other objects.
# ADDING AND REMOVING PROPERTIES :
   * created an object and you can add new properties to it.
   * using the dot notation to add new properties and you can access them just like any of the objects other properties.
* To delete a property, you use the keyword delete, and then use dot notation to identify the property or method you want to remove from the object.
# THIS (IT IS A KEYWORD): 
The keyword this is used inside functions and objects.
Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers
to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.
1. A FUNCTION IN GLOBAL SCOPE : When a function is created at the top level of a script that is, not inside another object or function, then it is in the global scope or global context.
2. GLOBAL VARIABLES : All global variables also become properties of the
window object. so when a function is in the global context, you can access global variables using the window object, as well as its other properties.
3. A METHOD OF AN OBJECT :When a function is defined inside an object, it becomes a method. In a method, this refers to the containing object.
4. FUNCTION EXPRESSION AS METHOD :If a named function has been defined in global scope, and it is then used as a method of an object,this refers to the object it is contained within.

# STORING DATA :
data is represented using name/value pairs.To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.The types of data :
1. VARIABLES : has just one key the variable name and one value.And Variable names are separated from their value by an equals sign the assignment operator.
2. ARRAYS : Arrays can store multiple pieces of information.Each piece of information is separated by a comma.The order of the values is important because items in an array are assigned a number called an index.
3. INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS : Objects store sets of name/value pairs. They can be properties variables or methods functions.Objects created with literal notation are good When you are storing I transmitting data
between applications and For global or configuration objects that set up
information for the page.
4. MULTIPLE OBJECTS :When you need to create multiple objects within the
same page, you should use an object constructor to provide a template for the objects. and You then create instances of the object using the new keyword and then a call to the constructor function.it's good when You have lots of objects used with similar functionality multiple slideshows I media players/ game characters within a page; and for A complex object might not be used in code.

# WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS?
An object model is a group of objects, each of which represent related things from the real world. Together they form a model of something larger.There are 3 groupes bulit in the object :

 1. BROWSER OBJECT MODEL
 2. DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
 3. GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS

#   BROWSER OBJECT MODEL :
The window object represents the current browser window or tab. It is the topmost object in the Browser Object Model, and it contains other objects that tell you about the browser.data about the browser is
col lected from the window object and its children, stored in the msg
variable, and shown in the page.The+= operator adds data onto the end of the msg variable.
# DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL :
The topmost object in the Document Object Model (or DOM) is the
document object. It represents the web page loaded into the current
browser window or tab.
# GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS :
this has many types of global :
1. STRING OBJECT :
Whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties
and methods of the String object on that value.Each character in a string is automatically given a number, called an index number. Index numbers always start at zero and not one just like for items in an array
2. NUMBER OBJECT :
Whenever you have a value that is a number,you can use the methods and properties of the Number object on it. These methods are helpful
when dealing with a range of applications from financial calculations to animations.COMMONLY USED :
  * integer
  * real number
  * floating point number
  * Scientific notation
3. MATH OBJECT :
The Math object has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions.Because it is known as a global object, you can just use the name of the Math object followed by the property or method you
want to access. and math object to create random numbers.
4. DATE OBJECT :
Once you have created a Date object, the following methods let you set
and retrieve the time and date that it represents.you can construct
a different date format using the individual methods listed above
to represent the individual parts: day, date, month, year.
