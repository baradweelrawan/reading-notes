# Links :
Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
# Writing Links:
Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.The text between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag is known as link text. 
# Linking to Other Sites :
1. <a> : Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute
called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.Users can click on anything that appears between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.
# Linking to Other Pages on the Sa me Site :
1. <a> When you are linking to other pages within the same site,you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just the name of the file.If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you can use a slightly more complex syntax to indicate where the page is in relation to the current page.
# Directory Structure :
to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.
1. Structure: The top-level folder is known as the root folder.the root folder is called examplearts. The root folder contains all of the other files and folders for a website.
2. Rela tionships :The relationship between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree.
3. Homepages: The main homepage of a site written in HTML and the homepages of each section in a child folder is called index.html.Web servers are usually set up to return the index.html file if no file name is specified.
# Relative URLs:
can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.You can use relative URLs which are a shorthand way to tell the browser where a page is in relation to the current page.This is especially helpful when
creating a new website or learning about HTML because you can create links between pages when they are only on your personal computer before
you have got a domain name and uploaded them to the web.If your site is organized into separate folders or directories, you need to tell the browser how to get from the page it is currently on to the page that you
are linking to.
# Relative Link Type :
 * Same Folder
 * Child Folder
 * Grandchild Folder
 * Parent Folder
 *GrandParent Folder
# Email Links:
1. mailto:To create a link that starts up the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a>
element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.
# Opening Links in a New Window :
1. target: If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.One of the most common reasons a web page author
might want a link to be opened in a new window is if it points to
another website. In such cases, they hope the user will return
to the window containing their site after finishing looking at the
other one.
# Linking to a Sp ecificPart of Another Page :
If you want to link to a specific part of a different page whether
on your own site or a different website, you can use a similar
technique.As long as the page you are linking to has id attributes that
identify specific parts of the page, you can simply add the same syntax to the end of the link for that page.the href attribute will contain the address for the page either an absolute URL or a relative URL), followed by the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute that is used on the element you are linking to.
# Layout :
1. Key Concepts in Positioning Elements:
  * Building Blocks :CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text.
  1. Block-level elements start on a new line
  2. Inline elements flow in between surrounding text

  * Containing Elements:If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
# Controlling the Position of Elements:
positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
1. Normal flow
2. Relative Positioning
3. Ab solute positioning
4. Fixed Positioning
5. Floating Elements
# Normal Flow:
* position:static :In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat
HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be: position: static;
# Relative Positioning :
Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.You can indicate that an element should be relatively positioned using the position property with a value of relative.You then use the offset properties to indicate how
far to move the element from where it would have been in normal flow.
# Absolute Positioning :
When the position property is given a value of absolute,the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page. The box offset properties specify where the element should appear in relation to its containing element.
# Fixed Positioning :
is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property
to have a value of fixed.It positions the element in relation to the browser window.
# Overlapping Elements :
1. z-index :When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can overlap. If boxes do overlap, the elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page.The z-index is sometimes referred to as the stacking context (as if the blocks have been stacked on top of each other on a z axis). If you are
familiar with desktop publishing packages, it is the equivalent
of using the 'bring to front' and 'send to back' features. 
# Floating Elements:
1. float : allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.Anything else that sits inside the containing element will flow around the element that is floated.
# Clearing Floats (clear):
allows you
to say that no element within the same containing element should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. It can take the following values:
1. left :The left-hand side of the box should not touch any other
elements appearing in the same containing element.
2. right: The right-hand side of the box will not touch elements
appearing in the same containing element.
3. both: Neither the left nor right-hand sides of the box will touch
elements appearing in the same containing element.
4. none: Elements can touch either side.
# Creating Multi-Column Layouts with Floats:
This is achieved by using a <div> element to represent each column. The following three CSS properties are used to position the columns next to each other:
1. width: This sets the width of the columns.
2. float :This positions the columns next to each other.
3. margin :This creates a gap between the columns.
# Fixed Width Layouts:
designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases
the size of their browser window. Measurements tend  to be given in pixels.
# Liquid Layouts :
designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the
size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
# A Fixed Width Layout :
To create a fixed width layout, the width of the main boxes on a page will usually be specified in pixels and sometimes their height, too.The fixed width layout will stay the same width no matter what size the browser window is, whereas the liquid layout will stretch (or shrink) to fill the screen.
# Layout Grids :
Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements — how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.
# CSS Frameworks :
aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.They save you from repeatedly writing code for the same tasks.They will have been tested across different browser versions which helps avoid browser bugs.They often require that you use class names in your HTML code that only control the presentation of the page rather than describe its content.
# Multiple Style Sheets :
1. @import :Some web page authors split up their CSS style rules into
separate style sheets.There are two ways to add multiple style sheets to a page:
   1. Your HTML page can link to one style sheet and that stylesheet can use the @import rule to import other style sheets.
   2. In the HTML you can use a separate <link> element for each style sheet.
   
   # BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS :

   A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
   # Functions and method objects :
   Functions consist of a In Chapter 1 you saw that The browser comes with series of statements programmers use objects a set of objects that act that have been grouped to create models of the like a toolkit for creating together because they world using data, and that interactive web pages.perform a specific task. objects are made up of This section introduces A method is the same as a properties and methods. you to a number of built-in function, except methods In this section, you learn objects, which you will are created inside and are how to create your own then see used throughout part of an object. objects using JavaScript. the rest of the book.
   #  A FUNCTION :
   Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements.
# Declearing  A FUNCTION :
give it a name and then write  the statment needed to achive its task inside the curly braces.
# Calling A FUNCTION :
after declerinf the function you can excuted it by calling it .
# HOW MEMORY & VARIABLES WORK :
Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them
for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.
1. CREATING THE VARIABLES IN CODE: Each variable that you declare takes up memory. The more va ri ables a browser has to remember,the more memory your script requires to run. Scripts that require a lot of memory can perform slower, which in turn makes your web page take
longer to respond to the user.
2. NAMING COLLISIONS :You might think you would avoid naming collisions;
after all you know which va riables you are using.But many sites use scripts written by several people.If an HTML page uses two JavaScript files, and both have a global variable with the same name, it can
cause errors.
# How does pair programming work?:
here are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
# Why pair program? :
Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
1. Greater efficiency
2.  Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students.
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
