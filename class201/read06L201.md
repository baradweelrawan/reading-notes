# WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 
a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

1. IN AN OBJECT VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES.Properties te ll us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.Each individual hotel might have a different name and a different number of rooms.
2. IN AN OBJECT FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS.Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.
3. variables and named functions, properties and methods have a name and a va lue. In an object,that name is called a key.An object cannot have two keys with the same name.because keys are used to access
their corresponding values.
# creating an object :
the object is the curly braces and their content.it's stored in variable .seperat each key from it's value using colone. seperate each property and method with a comma

# Accessing an object :
you can access an object by using dot notation. or you can access properties  using squer brackets . To access properties or methode of an object use the name of the object followed by a period (member operator) then the name of properties or methode you want to access.

# Document Object Model (DOM) :

![img](https://i.morioh.com/5014339ce7.png)

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules.It is implemented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas:
    1. MAKING A MODEL OF THE HTML PAGE: The DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using a DOM tree.
    2. ACCESSING AND CHANGING THE HTML PAGE: The DOM also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in this model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.You will hear people call the DOM an Application Programming Interface (API).User interfaces let humans interact with programs; APls let programs and scripts talk to each other.

# THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE :
As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.
The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.It consists of four main types of nodes.   
  1. THE DOCUMENT NODE : Every element, attribute, and piece of text in the HTML is represented by its own DOM node.At the top of the tree a document node is added; it represents the entire page and also corresponds to the document object.When you access any element, attribute, or text node, you navigate to it via the document node. It is the starting point for all visits to the DOM tree.

  2. ELEMENT NODES :HTML elements describe the structure of an HTML
page.To access the DOM tree, you start by looking for elements. Once you find the element you want, then you can access its text and attribute nodes if you want to.
3. ATTRIBUTE NODES :The opening tags of HTML elements can carry
attributes and these are represented by attribute nodes in the DOM tree. Attribute nodes are not children of the element tharcarries them; they are part of that element. Once you access an element, there are specific JavaScript methods and properties to read or change that
element's attributes.
4. TEXT NODES :Once you have accessed an element node, you can then reach the text within that element. This is stored in its own text node.Text nodes cannot have children. If an element contains text and another child element, the child element is not a child of the text node but rather a child of the containing element.
# WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE :
Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
   1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
   2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.
* STEP 1: ACCESS THE ELEMENTS :
      1. SELECT AN INDIVIDUAL ELEMENT NODE: Here are three common ways to select an individual element:
          * get El ement Byld ().
          * querySe 1 ector ().
          * You can also select individual elements by traversing from one element to another within the DOM tree.

      2. SELECT MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (NODELISTS):There are three common ways to select multiple elements:
          * getElementsByClassName().
          * getElementsByTagName().
          * querySelectorAll() .
          
      3. TRAVERSING BETWEEN ELEMENT NODES:You can move from one element node to a related element node:
          * parentNode.
          * previousSibling / nextSibling.
          * firstChild / lastChild.
The terms elements and element nodes are used interchangeably but when people say the DOM is working with an element,it is actually working with a node that represents that element.

* STEP 2: WORK WITH THOSE ELEMENTS :
       1. ACCESS/ UPDATE TEXT NODES : The text inside any element is stored inside a text node. To access the text node :
           * Select the <tag >element
           * Use the fi rstChild property to get the text node.
           * Use the text node's only property (nodeVa l ue) to get the text from the element.
       2. WORK WITH HTML CONTENT: One property allows access to child elements and text content: 
            * innerHTML
            * textContent
         to create new nodes, add nodes to a tree,and remove nodes from a tree: 
             1. create Element()
             2. createTextNode()
             3. appendChild () / removeChild ()    
       3. ACCESS OR UPDATE ATTRIBUTE VALUES : Here are some of the properties and methods you can use to work with attributes:
             * className /id
             *hasAttr i bute()
             * getAttribute()
             * setAttri bute()
             * removeAttribute()  
# Caching Dom Queries :
      Dom Queries : method that find elements in the Dom tree.when you want to work with an element more than once;you should use a variable to store the result of this query  .when you store the elements in a variable you really storing the location of the elements within the Dom tree in a varaible.
# ACCESSING ELEMENTS :
DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist,
which is a collection of nodes.Sometimes you will just want to access one individual element or a fragment of the page that is stored within that one element. Other times you may want to select a group of elements.
   1. GROUPS OF ELEMENT NODES :
       * If a method can return more than one node, it will always return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes even if it only finds one matching element. 
       * If a method can return more than one node, it will always return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes even if it only finds one matching element.  
    2. FASTEST ROUTE :
    Finding the quickest way to access an element within your web page will make the page seem faster and/or more responsive.means evaluating the minimum number of nodes on the way to the element you want to work with.          
# METHODS THAT RETURN A SINGLE ELEMENT NODE:
  1. getElementByld( 'id' ) :Selects an individual element given the value of its i d attribute . The HTML must have an id attribute in order for it to be selectable.
  2. querySel ector( 'css selector'):Uses CSS selector syntax that would select one or more elements .This method returns only the first of the matching elements.
# METHODS THAT RETURN ONE OR MORE ELEMENTS (AS A NODELIST):
  1. getEl ement sByClassName( 'class '):Selects one or more elements given the va lue of their cl ass attribute.The HTML must have a cl ass attribu te for it to be selectable.This method is faster than querySe1ectorA11 () .
  2. getEl ementsByTagName( 'tagName '):Selects all elements on the page with the specified tag name. This method is faster than querySe1ectorA11 ().
  3. querySelectorAll ( 'css selector '):Uses CSS selector syntax to select one or more elements and returns all of those that match.
# SELECTING ELEMENTS USING ID ATTRIBUTES  :
get El ementByid () allows you to select a single element node by specifying the value of its id attribute.This method has one parameter: the value of the id attribute onthe element you want to select.This value is placed inside quote marks because it is a string. The quotes can be single or double quotes, but they must match.
# DOM QUERIES THAT RETURN MORE THAN ONE ELEMENT :
DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist even if it only finds one matching element.A Nodelist is a collection of element nodes. Each node is given an index number a number that starts at zero, just like an array.When a DOM query returns a Nodelist, you may want to:
     1. Select one element from the NodeList.
     2. Loop through each item in the Nodelist and perform the same statements on each of the element nodes.
# collection :
Nodelists look like arrays and are numbered like arrays, but they are not ac tually arrays; they are a type of object.Like any other object, a Nodelist has properties and methods, notably: 
   * The length property tells you how many items are in the Nodelist.
   * The i tern() method returns a specific node from the Nodelist when you tell it the index number of the item that you want in the parentheses
# SELECTING ELEMENTS USING CLASS ATTRIBUTES :
The get El ementsByClass Name() method allows you to select elements whose class attribute contains a specific value.The method has one parameter: the class name which is given in quotes within the parentheses after the method name.Because several elements can
have the same value for their class attribute, this method always returns a Nodelist.

# SELECTING ELEMENTS BY TAG NAME:
The get El ementsByTagName () method allows you to select elements using their tag name.The element name is specified as a parameter, so it is placed inside the parentheses and is contained by quote marks.Note that you do not include the angled brackets that surround the tag name in the HTML just the letters inside the brackets.

# SELECTING ELEMENTS USING CSS SELECTORS :
1. querySelector() returns the first element node that matches the CSS-style selector.
2. querySelectorAll () returns a Nodelist of all of the matches.Both methods take a CSS selector as their only parameter.
The CSS selector syntax offers more flexibility and accuracy when selecting an element than just specifying a class name or a tag name, and should also be familiar to front-end web developers who are used to targeting elements using CSS.

# LOOPING THROUGH A NODELIST :
If you want to apply the same code to numerous elements,looping through a Nodelist is a powerful technique.It involves finding out how many items are in the Nodelist, and then setting a counter to loop
through them, one-by-one.
# TRAVERSING THE DOM :
When you have an element node, you can select another element in relation to it using these five properties. This is known as traversing the DOM.
  1. parentNode :This property finds the element node for the containing or parent element in the HTML.
     * If you started with the first <l i >element, then its parent node would be the one representing the <ul >element.
  2. previousSibling nextSibling : These properties find the
previous or next sibling of a node if there are siblings.  If you started with the first <li> element, it would not have a previous sibling. However, its next sibling ; would be the noderepresenting the second <li >.
  3. firstChild lastChild: These properties find the first or
last child of the current element. If you started with the <u1 > element, the first child would be the node representing the first
<l i> element, and ; the last child would be the last <1i >. 

# WHITESPACE NODES :
Traversing the DOM can be difficult because some browsers add a text node whenever they come across whitespace between elements.Most browsers, except IE, treat whitespace between elements such as spaces or carriage returns as a text node, so the properties below return different elements in different browsers ;you can see all of the
whitespace nodes added to the DOM tree for the list example:
   * previousSibling
   * nextSiblfng
   * firstChild
   * lastChild 
# FlRST & LAST CHILD :
These properties also return inconsistent resu lts if there is whitespace between elements.In this example, a slightly different solution is used in the HTML - the closing tags are put next to the opening tags of the next element, making it a little more readable.

# ACCESS & UPDATE A TEXT NODE WITH NODEVALUE: 
When you select a text node, you can retrieve or amend the content of it using the node Va 1 ue property.In order to use node Va 1 ue, you
must be on a text node, not the element that contains the text.
# ACCESSING & CHANGING A TEXT NODE :
To work with text in an element, first the element node is accessed and then its text node.The text node has a property called node Value which returns the text in that text node.You can also use the node Value property to update the content of a text node.
# ACCESS & UPDATE TEXT WITH TEXTCONTEN & INNERTEXT:
The textCon tent property allows you to collect or update just the text that is in the containing element and its children.
 * textContent: collects the words fresh figs.
 * innerText.
# ACCESSING TEXT ONLY :
In order to demonstrate the difference between textContent and i nnerText, this examplefeatures a CSS rule to hide the contents of the <em> element. The script starts off by getting the content of the first list item using both the textContent property and i nnerText. It then writes the values after the list.Finally, the value of the first list item is then updated to say sourdough bread. This is done
using the textContent property.

# ACCESS & UPDATE TEXT & MARKUP WITH INNERHTML :
Using the i nnerHTML property, you can access and amend the contents of an element,including any child elements.When getting HTML from an
element, the i nnerHTML property will get the content of an element and return it as one long string, including any markup that the element contains.
   * When used to set new content for an element, it will take a string that can contain markup and process that string, adding any elements within it to the DOM tree.
   * When adding new content using innerHTML, be aware that one missing closing tag could throw out the design of the entire page.
Even worse, if i nnerHTML is used to add content that your users
created to a page, they could add malicious content.   

# ADDING ELEMENTS USING DOM MANIPULATION:
DOM manipulation offers another technique to add new content to a page rather than i nnerHTML. It involves three steps:
  1. createEl ement (): CREATE THE ELEMENT;You start by creating a new element node using the createElement() method.This element node is stored in a variable.When the element node is created, it is not yet part of the DOM tree. It is not added to the DOM tree until step 3.
  2. createTextNode(): GIVE IT CONTENT;creates a Now that you have your element new text node. Again, the node (optionally with some content is stored in a variable. It can be in a text node), you can add added to the element node using it to the DOM tree using the the appendChild () method.This provides the content for the The appendChi 1 d () method element, although you can skip allows you to specify which this step if you want to attach an element you want this nodeempty element to the DOM tree.
  3. appendChild() : ADD IT TO THE DOM;Now that you have your element
new text node. Again, the node optionally with some content is stored in a variable. It can be in a text node, you can add added to the element node using it to the DOM tree using the  appendChild () method. The appendChild () method allows you to specify which element you want this node added to, as a child of it.

# ADDING AN ELEMENT TO THE DOM TREE :
 * createEl ement () :
creates an element that can be added to theDOM tree, in this case an empty<li >element for the list.This new element is stored inside a variable called newEl until it is attached to the DOM tree later on.
* createTextNode() :
allows you to create a new text node to attach to an element. It is stored in a variable called newText.The text node is added to
the new element node using appendChild ().
* The get ElementsByTagName (): 
method selects the position in the DOM tree to insert the new element the first <ul >element in the page.
* appendChild ():
is used again - this time to insert the new element and its content into the DOM tree.

# REMOVING ELEMENTS VIA DOM MANIPULATION :
DOM manipulation can be used to remove elements from the DOM tree.
  1. STORE THE ELEMENT TO BE REMOVED IN A VARIABLE.
  2. STORE THE PARENT OF THAT ELEMENT IN A VARIABLE.
  3. REMOVE THE ELEMENT FROM ITS CONTAINING ELEMENT.

# COMPARING TECHNIQUES UPDATING HTML CONTENT :
three techniques for adding HTML to a web page. It's time to compare when you should use each one.
  1. document.write()
  2. eZement.innerHTML
  3. DOM MANIPULATION
