# Error Handling & Debugging:
When you are writing JavaScript, do not expect to write it perfectly the first time.Programming is like problem solving: you are given a puzzle and not only do you have to solve it, but you also need to create the instructions that allow the computer to solve it. too.
When writing a long script, nobody gets everything right in their first attempt. The error messages that a browser gives look cryptic at first, but they can help you determine what went wrong in your JavaScript and how to fix it. In this chapter you will learn about:
  1. THE CONSOLE & DEV TOOLS.
  2. COMMON PROBLEMS.
  3. HANDLING ERRORS.
# EXECUTION CONTEXT :
The JavaScript interpreter uses the concept of execution contexts.
There is one global execution context; plus, each function creates a new new execution context. They correspond to variable scope.Every statement in a script lives in one of three execution contexts:  
  1. GLOBAL CONTEXT:Code that is in the script, but not in a function.There is only one global context in any page.
  2. FUNCTION CONTEXT:Code that is being run within a function.Each function has its own function context.
  3. EVAL CONTEXT:Text is executed like code in an internal function called eval ().

# VARIABLE SCOPE :
1. GLOBAL SCOPE :If a variable is declared outside a function, it can
be used anywhere because it has global scope.If you do not use the var keyword when creating a variable, it is placed in global scope.
2. FUNCTION-LEVEL SCOPE: When a variable is declared within a function,
it can only be used within that function. This is because it has function-level scope.

# UNDERSTANDING ERRORS :
If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception.At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handling code.If you are anticipating that something in your code may cause an error, you can use a set of statements to handle the error.This is important because if the error is not handled,the script will just stop processing and the user will not know why. So exception-handling code should inform users when there is a problem.

# ERROR OBJECTS :
Error objects can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them.There are seven types of built-in error objects in JavaScript. You'll see them on the next two pages:
  1. Error :the other errors are all based upon this error.The generic Error object is the template or prototype from which all other error objects are created.
  2. Syntax Error: Syntax has not been followed.This is caused by incorrect use of the rules of the language. It is often the result of a simple typo.
  3. Reference Error:Tried to reference a variable that is not declared/within scope.This is caused by a variable that is not declared or is out of scope.
  4. Type Error: An unexpected data type that cannot be coerced.This is often caused by trying to use an object or method that does not exist.
  5. Range Error: Numbers not in acceptable range.If you call a function using numbers outside of its accepted range.
  6. URI Error:encodeURI ().decodeURI(),and similar methods used incorrectly.If these characters are not escaped in URls, they will cause an error: / ? & I : ;
  7. Eval Error:eval() function used incorrectly.
  8. NaN :If you perform a mathematical operation using a value that is not a number, you end up with the value of NaN, not a type error.

# HOW TO DEAL WITH ERRORS :
there are two things you can do with the errors:
1. DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS
2. HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY: You can handle errors gracefully using try, catch, throw, and finally statements.Sometimes, an error may occur in the script for a reason beyond your control.

# DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS:
If you come across an error while writing a script or when someone reports a bug, you will need to debug the code, track down the source of the error,and fix it.You will find that the developer tools available in every major modern browser will help you with this task.Debugging is about deduction: eliminating potential causes of an error.
Here is a workflow for techniques you will meet over the next 20 pages.
Try to narrow down where the problem might be, then look for clues.
   * Look at the error message,it tells you:The relevant script that caused the problem.And The line number where it became a problem for the interpreter.And The type of error although the underlying cause of the error may be different.
   * Check how far the script is running.Use tools to write messages to the console to tell how far your script has executed.
   * Use breakpoints where things are going wrong.They let you pause execution and inspect the values that are stored in variables.

# HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY:
 You can handle errors gracefully using try, catch, throw, and finally statements.Sometimes, an error may occur in the script for a reason beyond your control.

# BROWSER DEV TOOLS & JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE:
The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script,where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be.The JavaScript console is just one of severa l developer tools that are found in all modern browsers.
 
# WRITING FROM THE SCRIPT TO THE CONSOLE:
Browsers that have a console have a console object, which has several
methods that your script can use to display data in the console.
The object is documented in the Console API.
  1. The console.log() method can write data from a script to the console. If you open console- l og. html, you will see that a note is written to the console when the page loads.
  2. Such notes can tell you how far a script has run and what values it has received.
  3. Writing out variables lets you see what va lues the interpreter holds for them.
  4. console.info() can be used for general information 
  5. console.warn() can be used for warnings.
  6. console .error () can be used to hold errors.
If you want to write a set of related data to the console, you can use the console. group ()method to group the messages together. You can then expand and contract the results. 
* In browsers that support it, the console. table () method lets
you output a table showing:objects,arrays that contain other
objects or arrays
* you can test if a condition is met, and write to the console only if the expression evaluates to false.by using the console. assert()
method  .

# BREAKPOINTS :
You can pause the execution of a script on any line using breakpoints. Then you can check the va lues stored in variables at that point in time.
* CONDITIONAL BREAKPOINTS:You can indicate that a breakpoint should be
triggered only if a condition that you specify is met. The condition can use existing variables.

# HANDLING EXCEPTIONS :
If you know your code might fail, use try, catch, and finally.
Each one is given its own code block.
1. TRY :First, you specify the code that you t hink might throw an
exception within the try block.The try clause must be used in
this type of error handling code,and it should always have either
a catch, finally, or both.If you use a continue, break, or return keyword inside a try, it will go to the finally option.
2. CATCH :If the try code block throws an exception, catch steps in with an alternative set of code.It has one parameter: the error
object. Although it is optional,you are not handling the error if
you do not catch an error.The ability to catch an error can
be very helpful if there is an issue on a live website.
3. FINALLY: The contents of the finally code block will run either
way - whether the try block succeeded or failed.It even runs if a return keyword is used in the try or catch block.It is sometimes used to clean up after the previous two clauses.
