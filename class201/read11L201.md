# Controlling sizes of images in CSS:
You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.First you need to determine the sizes of images that will be used commonly throughout the site, then give each size a name (small ,medium,large).Where the <img> elements appear in the HTML, rather than using width and height
attributes you can use these names as values for the class attribute.

# Aligning images Using CSS:
Rather than using the <img> element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:
  1. The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.
  2. New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

  # Centering images Using CSS :
  By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block.Once it has been made into a block-level element,there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:
    1. On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
    2. On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

# Background Images :
allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.The path to the image follows
the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes. 

# Repeating Images:
The background-repeat property can have 4 values:
  1. repeat : The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically he default way it is shown if the background repeat property isn't used.
  2. repeat-x: The image is repeated horizontally only .
  3. repeat-y : The image is repeated vertically only.
  4. no-repeat :The image is only shown once.The background-attachment property specifies whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page. It can have one of two values:
      * fixed :The background image stays in the same position on the page.
      * scroll :The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

# Background Position :
When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position
property to specify where in the browser window the background
image should be placed. This property usually has a pair of values. The first represents the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical.     

# shorthand :
The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property.The properties must be specified in the following order, but you can miss any value if you do not want to specify it.
   * background-color
   * background-image
   * background-repeat
   * background-attachment
   * background-position

# Image Rollovers & Sprites :
Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a
second style when a user moves their mouse over it known as a
rollover and a third style when they click on it.This is achieved by setting a background image for the link or button that has three different styles of the same button but only allows enough space to show one of them at a time.You can see the image we are using in this example on the right. It actually features two buttons on the one image. When a single image is used for several different parts of an
interface, it is known as a sprite.You can add the logo and other
interface elements, as well as buttons to the image. 

# Contrast of background images:
If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low
contrast in order for the text to be legible.
  1. High Contrast: The majority of photographs have quite a high contrast, which means that they are not ideal for use as a background image.
  2. Low Contrast :Image editing applications such as Photoshop and GIMP have tools that allow you to manually adjust your images to have lower contrast.
  3. Screen :To overlay text on an image with high contrast, you can place a semi-transparent background color or "screen" behind the text to improve legibility.

# Practical Information :

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO):
SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.
The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can
improve your website's visibility on search engines. 
1. The Basics:Search engine optimization or SEO is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics that your website covers.At the heart of SEO is the idea of working out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines will show a link to your site in their results.

2. On-Page Techniques: On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines.The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine if they wanted to find your site, and then including these in the text and HTML code for your site in order to help the search engines know that your site covers these topics.

3. Off-Page Techniques: Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours.They are particularly interested in sites whose content is related
to yours. For example, if you were running a website that sold fish bait, then a link from a hairdresser is not likely to be considered as relevant as one from an angling community.

# How to Identify Keywords and Phrases :
Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.
1. Brainstorm : List down the words that someone might type into
Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics,products or services your site is about.Your list may include some
keyword phrases not just individual words if you have topics which are described by more than one word.
2. Organize :Group the keywords into separate lists for the different
sections or categories of your website.On a large site you may
break this up further into sub-categories.
3. Research :There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to
consider.Once these tools have suggested additional keywords, add the
relevant options to your lists.Keyword tools will most likely
suggest some terms that are irrelevant so do omit any that do
not seem appropriate.
4. Compare : It is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of the search results for every keyword. This is especially true
for topics where there is a lot of competition. The more sites
out there that have already been optimized for a given keyword,the harder it will be for you to rise up the search results when people search on that term.
5. Refine: Now you need to pick which keywords you will focus on.
These should always be the ones that are most relevant to each section of your site.there is a phrase that is very relevant but you find there is a lot of competition, you should still use it. To improve the
chances of your site being found you can look at whether there
are other words that could be incorporated into a phrase. 
6. Map :Now that you have a refined list of keywords, you know which
have the most competition, and which ones are most relevant,it is time to start picking which keywords you will use for each page.Pick 3-5 keywords or phrases that map to each page of your website and use these as the keywords for each page.You should not need to repeat
the same keywords on all of the pages. It is also likely that,as you move further away from the homepage into the sections of the site, the keywords will become more specific to the individual topic dealt with on
each page.

# FTP & Third Party Tools :
To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use something known as File Transfer Protocol.As the name suggests, File Transfer Protocol or FTP allows you to transfer files across the Internet from your computer to the web server hosting your site.There are many FTP programs that offer a simple interface
that shows you the files on your computer alongside the files that
are on your web server. These allow you to drag and drop files from your computer to the server or vice versa.There are a wide variety of sites that offer services commonly created by web developers to save you having to build them yourself.Here is a list of some popular
FTP applications:
  * FileZilla
  * FireFTP
  * CuteFTP
  * SmartFTP
  * Transmit 
Here is a list of some popular third party tools:  
  * Blogs
  * E-commerce
  * Email newsletters
  * Social networking sharing buttons
