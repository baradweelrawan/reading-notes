# Comparison and logical operators: 
 we can evaluated a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be, and the result will be a boolean(true or false).
       1. equal to(==): this operator compares two values to see if they are the same. the valuescould be bool,string,numbers.
       2. not equal to(!=):this operator compares two values to see if they are not the same.
       3. strict equal to(===): this operator compares two values to check the data type and the value same.
       4. strict not equal to(!==): this operator compares two values to check the data type and the value are not same.
       5. greater than (>): this operator check if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
       6. less than (<): this operator check if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.
       7. greater than or equal to (>=): this operator check if the number on the left is greater than or equal the number on the right
       8. less than or equal (<):this operator check if the number on the left is less than or equal the number on the right.

# logical Operators :
that allow you to compare the result of more thanon Comparison operator by usin (and ,or) operators (&&,||,!).
    * logical And(&&): this operator test more there one condition.
    * logical Or(||):  this operator test at least one condition.
    * logical Not(!):this operator takes a single boolean value and inverts it.
# Loops:
loops check the condition, if it returns true a code block will run.then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true the code block will run again.it will repeat until the condition return false.There are 3 common types of loop :
      1. FOR LOOP :to run a specific number of time and the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many time the should do run.
      2. WHILE LOOP : if you dont know how many times the code should run; the condition can be something other than counter and the code will countinue to loop for as long as the condition is true.
      3. DO WHILE LOOP:its similler to WHILE loop but has one key difference it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once even if condition evaluates to false.
# The Loops Counter : 
for loop uses a counter as a condition; this instructs the code to run for a specific number of time.
1. initialization : creat a variable and assign value to it.
2. condition : the loop should countinue to run until the counter reaches  a specified number.
3. update : every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces it adds one to the counter.
